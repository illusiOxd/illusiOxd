# About Me

I'm a backend-focused full-stack software engineer specializing in **ASP.NET Core (C#)**, **Python**, **Go (Golang)**, and with strong experience in **C++**.

My primary expertise is in building robust backend systems, scalable APIs, and database-driven applications, with clean architecture and high performance in mind.

I am a "polyglot" engineer, comfortable writing high-level asynchronous APIs (Python/Go) as well as working with low-level system calls and parallelism (C#/.NET, C++).

---

## 💼 Core Expertise

I divide my skills into several key domains:

### 1. Languages & Backend Development

- **ASP.NET Core (C#)**: Designing backend services and high-performance WPF desktop applications using low-level Windows APIs (WMI, Performance Counters).
- **Python**: Building modern, asynchronous APIs using FastAPI and Pydantic.
- **Go (Golang)**: Developing lightweight, high-performance microservices.
- **Advanced C++**: Strong background in creating high-performance, optimized, and efficient applications.

### 2. Architecture & Performance

- **Asynchronous & Parallel Programming**: Deep expertise in advanced `asyncio` patterns in Python (non-blocking I/O, `run_in_executor`) and advanced multithreading in C# (`Task.Run`, `Dispatcher.Invoke`, `Parallel.For`).
- **System & Architecture Design**: Designing systems from scratch using Clean Architecture principles and Software Design Patterns (e.g., Strategy Pattern).

### 3. Databases & Data

- **Database Design & Optimization**: PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB (incl. `motor`, aggregation pipelines, index optimization, and connection pool tuning), NeonDB, Supabase.
- **Database Internals & Concurrency**: Understanding of data integrity and parallelism challenges, including the practical implementation of Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) to prevent race conditions.

### 4. Other Skills

- **Authentication & Security**: Proven experience implementing full-stack JWT (JOSE) authentication lifecycles, OAuth 2.0 (Google Login) integration, secure password hashing (`bcrypt`), and data integrity checks.
- **DevOps & Tools**: Docker, Docker Compose, Git.
- **Frontend (supporting role)**: React (beginner) for basic interfaces and admin panels.
- **Freelance Projects**: Delivered production-ready solutions on Fiverr.

## 🚀 Key Projects I'm Proud Of

### 1. Velora (Python Social Media API)

**Velora** is a complex, high-performance backend for a social media platform, built on `FastAPI`.

**Demonstrates**: Expertise in `asyncio` (incl. `run_in_executor` for `bcrypt`), NoSQL (`motor`, `MongoDB Aggregations`), full JWT + OAuth 2.0 implementation, and Custom Middleware creation in FastAPI.

### 2. SRC App (C# System Monitor)

**SRC App** is a C# / WPF (.NET 9) desktop application for real-time system resource monitoring.

**Demonstrates**: System-level C# mastery, working with WMI and `PerformanceCounter`, correct UI multithreading (`Dispatcher.Invoke`), and parallel computing (`Parallel.For`).

### 3. YaraDB (Python In-Memory Database)

**YaraDB** is a lightweight, `in-memory` JSON database concept, designed with reliability as a core feature.

**Demonstrates**: Deep understanding of database architecture, Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC), application of Design Patterns (Strategy), ensuring data integrity (`sha256`), and DevOps (`Docker`) skills.
