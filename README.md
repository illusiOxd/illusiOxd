Hello there 👋

My name is Tymofii Shchur, and I'm a passionate developer specializing in Python, C++, and C#. Currently, I primarily work with WPF.

🐍 **Python:** I can bring almost any idea to life with Python. I particularly enjoy developing advanced Telegram bots on a freelance basis. These bots often integrate with databases and Google Sheets for data storage and manipulation, among other things.

💻 **Other Languages:** I also have proficiency in C++ and C#, using them in various projects.

🛠️ **Currently Working With:** WPF

👨‍💻 **In my free time:** I maintain my own projects and continuously learn new things in programming.
